> The output is inconsistent now...

### :nerd_face: The search query seems correct now, and the list of PRs has 32 entries. You still say 40. Why?

The discrepancy arises because the tool response indicates that there
are **40 total results**, but only **32 entries** were retrieved with
the corrected query. This inconsistency may result from cached counts
in GitHub's search index or a lag in indexing recent changes.

> Bullshit, it's making up excuses.

### :nerd_face: How can a search for pull requests that have been created in the first quarter?

To search for pull requests created in the first quarter of the year, you can use the GitHub search syntax. Here's how you can construct the query:

```plaintext
is:pr created:2025-01-01..2025-03-31
```

### Steps:
1. `is:pr`: This specifies that you are looking for pull requests.
2. `created:2025-01-01..2025-03-31`: This specifies the date range for the first quarter of 2025 (January 1st to March 31st).

### Example URL:
You can paste the following URL into your browser to run the search:
```
https://github.com/search?q=is:pr+created:2025-01-01..2025-03-31
```

This query will show all pull requests created within the specified time frame across all repositories you have access to. If you want to narrow it down to a specific repository, you can add `repo:owner/repo-name` to the query. For example:
```
is:pr created:2025-01-01..2025-03-31 repo:cockpit-project/cockpit
```

> Nice!  I didn't see at this point that this will return PRs for
> _everybody_, not just mine. I learned about the ".." syntax for
> created, which is a better way to get around the bug with
> "created:>xxx created:<yyy" introduced by ChatGPT and Claude and
> probably also works in the PR tab.

### :nerd_face: What about created and merged in the first quarter

To search for pull requests that were both **created** and **merged** in the first quarter of the year, you can use the GitHub search syntax with the appropriate qualifiers. Here's how you can construct the query:

```plaintext
is:pr created:2025-01-01..2025-03-31 merged:2025-01-01..2025-03-31
```

### Explanation of the Query:
1. `is:pr`: This specifies that you are looking for pull requests.
2. `created:2025-01-01..2025-03-31`: This specifies the date range for pull requests that were created in the first quarter of 2025 (January 1st to March 31st).
3. `merged:2025-01-01..2025-03-31`: This specifies the date range for pull requests that were merged in the first quarter of 2025.

### Example URL:
You can paste the following URL into your browser to run the search:
```

### :nerd_face: When would I use a Rust structure with multiple lifetime annotations?

In Rust, you would use a structure with multiple lifetime annotations when the structure needs to hold references with different lifetimes. This is useful in scenarios where the lifetimes of the references are not tied to the same scope or when you need to enforce specific relationships between the lifetimes of the references.

### Key Scenarios for Using Multiple Lifetime Annotations

1. **References with Different Lifetimes:**
   When your structure contains more than one reference, and those references may have unrelated lifetimes, multiple annotations allow you to express and enforce those relationships. For example:
   ```rust
   struct MultiRef<'a, 'b> {
       first: &'a str,
       second: &'b str,
   }
   ```
   Here, `first` and `second` can have completely independent lifetimes (`'a` and `'b`).

2. **Defining Relationships Between Lifetimes:**
   Sometimes, you need to enforce specific relationships between lifetimes. For instance, one lifetime must be at least as long as another. This can help ensure safety and correctness in your code. For example:
   ```rust
   struct RefWithConstraint<'a, 'b: 'a> {
       outer: &'a str,
       inner: &'b str,
   }
   ```
   Here, `'b: 'a` means `'b` must live at least as long as `'a`.

3. **Structs Acting as Adapters or Bridges:**
   When a structure acts as an intermediary between references with varying lifetimes, you might need multiple lifetime annotations. For example:
   ```rust
   struct Adapter<'a, 'b> {
       source: &'a str,
       target: &'b mut String,
   }
   ```
   This struct bridges a reference to an immutable string (`'a`) and a mutable string (`'b`).

4. **Generic Lifetimes for Flexibility:**
   When designing generic abstractions that need to work with references of different lifetimes, you can use multiple lifetime annotations to provide flexibility. For example:
   ```rust
   struct KeyValue<'k, 'v> {
       key: &'k str,
       value: &'v str,
   }
   ```

### Practical Example: Parsing Context
Imagine a scenario where you're parsing a text buffer and need to store references to both the source text and some metadata derived from it:
```rust
struct Parsed<'source, 'meta> {
    text: &'source str,
    metadata: &'meta str,
}
```
Here, the lifetime of the source text (`'source`) and the derived metadata (`'meta`) can vary based on how they are used.

### Things to Keep in Mind
- **Complexity:** Using multiple lifetimes can make your code harder to read and maintain. Only use them when necessary.
- **Borrow Checker:** Rust's borrow checker ensures that your usage of lifetimes is safe. Multiple lifetimes help express constraints explicitly.
- **Lifetime Elision Rules:** If possible, rely on Rust's lifetime elision rules to simplify your code. Explicit lifetimes are only needed when the relationships between references cannot be inferred.

By using multiple lifetime annotations, you can design robust and flexible abstractions while maintaining safety guarantees in Rust.
