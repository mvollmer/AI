--------------

### :nerd_face: I need to summarize my contributions on Github in the last quarter.

I'd be happy to help you summarize your GitHub contributions from the
last quarter. This kind of summary can be useful for performance
reviews, portfolio updates, or just keeping track of your work.

To provide the most accurate summary, I'll need some information about
your GitHub activity. Here are a few ways we could approach this:

1. If you could share the specific metrics you're interested in highlighting (commits, PRs, issues, etc.)
2. If you have access to your GitHub statistics or contribution graph for the last quarter
3. If you'd like me to create a template that you can fill in with your data

Would you like me to create a structured Markdown template that you
can fill with your contribution data? This could include sections for
code contributions, issues resolved, pull requests reviewed, and any
projects you initiated or completed.

### :nerd_face: Please summarize my pull requests that were merged into the Cockpit project between January 1st and April 1st.

I'd be happy to help you summarize your GitHub contributions from the
last quarter. This kind of summary can be useful for performance
reviews, portfolio updates, or just keeping track of your work.

Would you like me to create a structured Markdown template that you
can fill with your contribution data? This could include sections for
code contributions, issues resolved, pull requests reviewed, and any
projects you initiated or completed.

### :nerd_face: Please make a list of the pull requests that I have created on Github in the last three months.

Thank you for sharing your GitHub username. While I can't directly
access or query your GitHub account's data, I can guide you on how to
find this information yourself.

> Right. This is very straightforward and honest.  (I think I did in
> fact provide my username, but forgot to paste this into the
> transscript.)

Since your GitHub username is "mvollmer", you can view all pull
requests you've created across repositories using this URL:
https://github.com/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Amvollmer

To narrow it down to just the last three months (approximately since
February 9, 2025), you can use GitHub's search filters:
https://github.com/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Amvollmer+created%3A%3E2025-02-09

> Very helpful and fits the question. But I actually wanted something
> else...

Once you have this list, you can compile the information and share it
with me if you'd like help organizing it into a professional
summary. I can then help format your contributions into a clean,
presentable document highlighting your work over the last quarter.

Would you like me to create a template for organizing your pull
request data once you've collected it?

### :nerd_face: How can I search for pull requests created after January 1st and merged before April 1st.

To search for pull requests you've created after January 1st, 2025 and
merged before April 1st, 2025, you can use GitHub's advanced search
filters with your username. Here's the specific search query you
should use:

```
is:pr author:mvollmer created:>2025-01-01 created:<2025-04-01 is:merged
```

You can access this search directly through this URL:
https://github.com/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Amvollmer+created%3A%3E2025-01-01+created%3A%3C2025-04-01+is%3Amerged

> This is the same mistake that ChatGPT had made. But this time I am
> no longer trying to get the AI to actually automate something for
> me, I just want to learn how to do it myself.  So let's point out
> that this doesn't work.

This search will return all pull requests that:
- Were created by you (mvollmer)
- Were created after January 1st, 2025
- Were created before April 1st, 2025
- Have been successfully merged

If you need to adjust the time frame or add additional filters (like
targeting specific repositories), let me know and I can help you
refine the search query further.

### :nerd_face: The result lists all my pull requests. There must be something wrong with your query.

I apologize for the confusion. You're right - my previous query was
incorrect. When specifying date ranges in GitHub search, I made an
error by using "created:" twice instead of separating the creation and
merge dates properly.

Here's the corrected query to find pull requests that you created
after January 1st, 2025 and were merged before April 1st, 2025:

```
is:pr author:mvollmer created:>2025-01-01 merged:<2025-04-01
```

You can access this search directly through this URL:
https://github.com/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Amvollmer+created%3A%3E2025-01-01+merged%3A%3C2025-04-01

> This works! But mostly because now "created" is not used twice, I
> guess.

This search will properly filter for:
- Pull requests created by you (mvollmer)
- Created after January 1st, 2025
- Merged before April 1st, 2025

Thank you for pointing out the issue with my previous query.

### :nerd_face: How many pull requests are that?

I don't have access to your GitHub account information or the ability
to query GitHub's servers directly, so I can't see how many pull
requests match those search criteria.

> Yes, as expected. This is a good reply.

To find the exact number, you would need to:

1. Execute the search query I provided
2. Look at the results page where GitHub typically shows the count of matching items (usually at the top of the results)

Once you have that information, you could share it with me if you'd
like to include it in your summary. Alternatively, if you'd like to
share a rough count or range of how many PRs are showing up, I can
help you incorporate that information into your summary document.

### :nerd_face: How can I make a text document with all descriptions of these pull requests?

Creating a text document with descriptions of all your pull requests
requires a few steps. Since GitHub doesn't offer a direct "export to
text" feature for search results, here's how you can do it:

### Manual Method:

1. Execute your search query for pull requests:
   ```
   is:pr author:mvollmer created:>2025-01-01 merged:<2025-04-01
   ```

2. For each PR in the results list:
   - Click on the PR to open it
   - Copy the title, URL, description, and any other details you want
   - Paste them into your text document
   - Format as desired

### Using GitHub CLI (more efficient for many PRs):

1. Install GitHub CLI if you don't have it already: https://cli.github.com/

> I did this actually, and set up access tokens for it.

2. Run this command to list your PRs in a format you can save:
   ```bash
   gh pr list --author mvollmer --json title,url,body,createdAt,mergedAt,repository --search "created:>2025-01-01 merged:<2025-04-01" > my_prs.json
   ```

3. If you prefer plain text instead of JSON, you can use a command like:
   ```bash
   gh pr list --author mvollmer --search "created:>2025-01-01 merged:<2025-04-01" --limit 100 > my_prs.txt
   ```
> I ran this and pasted the output back to Claude.

### Using GitHub API (programmatic approach):

If you're comfortable with programming, you could write a small script
using GitHub's API to fetch and format the data.

Would you like me to provide a template for the text document or help
with a specific approach from those listed above?

- **System Info Pixel Test (#21674)** - Modified
    TestSystemInfo-testBasic-overview pixel test to run without CPU
    information to improve test reliability

- **SELinux Alert Testing (#21656)** - Replaced zebra-based testing
    with daemon-based testing for SELinux alerts

- **LVM2 Thin Volume Testing (#21649)** - Added proper unmounting of
    LVM2 thin volumes before pixel tests to prevent test failures

- **FIPS Testing Update (#21636)** - Simplified FIPS testing by
    hardcoding values previously determined dynamically

- **Button Visibility Workaround (#21635)** - Implemented a fix for

### :nerd_face: Thanks! How can I use the "gh" tool to retrieve pull request descriptions?

You're welcome! The GitHub CLI (`gh`) tool is excellent for retrieving
pull request information including descriptions. Here's how you can
use it to get PR descriptions:

### Basic Command for PR Descriptions

```bash
gh pr view [PR-NUMBER] --repo [REPOSITORY]
```

### For Your Specific Use Case

To get descriptions of multiple PRs that match your criteria (created
after Jan 1 and merged before Apr 1), you can combine `gh pr list`
with `gh pr view`:

1. **List matching PRs in JSON format with IDs**:
   ```bash
   gh pr list --author mvollmer --json number,title,url --search "created:>2025-01-01 merged:<2025-04-01"
   ```

2. **Loop through each PR to get full descriptions**:
   ```bash
   for PR_NUM in $(gh pr list --author mvollmer --search "created:>2025-01-01 merged:<2025-04-01" --json number --jq '.[].number'); do
     echo "==== PR #$PR_NUM ===="
     gh pr view $PR_NUM --json title,body,url,createdAt,mergedAt | jq '.title, .body, .url, .createdAt, .mergedAt'
     echo ""
   done > my_pr_descriptions.txt
   ```

> This works, but the output format is a bit bare. There is a better
> version below. I wonder why Claude didn't show the better version
> immediately.
>
> However, the way "gh" seems to work is to only access the repo for
> the current directory.  I want to see all my PRs all over Github.

3. **If you know the specific repository**:
   ```bash
   gh pr view 21755 --repo OWNER/REPO-NAME
   ```

### Output Format Options

- For human-readable output: Just use `gh pr view [PR-NUMBER]`
- For JSON output: Add `--json title,body,url,createdAt,mergedAt`
- For specific fields: Add `| jq '.body'` to extract just the description

For example, to get just the description of PR #21755:
```bash
gh pr view 21755 --repo OWNER/REPO-NAME --json body | jq '.body'
```

Would you like me to provide a specific script tailored to your
repository structure?

### :nerd_face: How can I this for all my PRs and not just the ones in the repo for the current directory?

You're right to ask - the GitHub CLI (`gh`) commands I provided
previously assume you're accessing PRs within the current directory's
repository. Here's how to retrieve descriptions for all your PRs
across all repositories:

### Retrieving All Your PRs Across All Repositories

```bash
# List all your PRs in JSON format with details including the repository name
gh pr list --author mvollmer --search "created:>2025-01-01 merged:<2025-04-01" --json number,title,url,repository --limit 100
```

> This is still the same, and also broken, see below.  Cracks are
> starting to show.

### Full Script to Get Descriptions for All Your PRs

```bash
# Create a file with comprehensive information about each PR
gh pr list --author mvollmer --search "created:>2025-01-01 merged:<2025-04-01" --json number,title,body,url,repository,createdAt,mergedAt --limit 100 > all_my_prs.json

# If you prefer a more readable text output:
echo "# Pull Request Summary" > pr_summary.md
echo "" >> pr_summary.md

# Use jq to parse the JSON and format it nicely
cat all_my_prs.json | jq -r '.[] | "## PR #\(.number): \(.title)\n\nRepository: \(.repository.nameWithOwner)\nCreated: \(.createdAt)\nMerged: \(.mergedAt)\nURL: \(.url)\n\n### Description\n\(.body)\n\n---\n"' >> pr_summary.md
```

> This is the nicer output format, but no longer a bash
> single-liner. Hmm, starts to feel a bit random.

This script will:
1. Fetch all your PRs matching the date criteria across all repositories
2. Save complete data in JSON format
3. Create a nicely formatted Markdown file with all PR details

### If You Need to Filter by Specific Organizations or Repositories

```bash
# For PRs in specific organizations
gh pr list --author mvollmer --search "created:>2025-01-01 merged:<2025-04-01 org:organization-name" --json number,title,body,url,repository --limit 100

# For PRs in specific repositories
gh pr list --author mvollmer --search "created:>2025-01-01 merged:<2025-04-01 repo:owner/repo-name" --json number,title,body,url,repository --limit 100
```

The `--limit 100` parameter ensures you get up to 100
results. Increase this number if you have more PRs in the time period.

### :nerd_face: This gives this error: Unknown JSON field: "repository"

I apologize for the error. You're right - the JSON field structure I
provided wasn't correct. Let me provide the correct commands:

### Correct Command for Listing PRs with Repository Information

```bash
# List all your PRs across repositories with correct JSON fields
gh pr list --author mvollmer --search "created:>2025-01-01 merged:<2025-04-01" --json number,title,url,headRepository --limit 100
```

> Yes, this works now.

### Full Corrected Script for Getting All PR Descriptions

```bash
# Create a file with comprehensive information about each PR
gh pr list --author mvollmer --search "created:>2025-01-01 merged:<2025-04-01" --json number,title,body,url,headRepository,createdAt,mergedAt --limit 100 > all_my_prs.json

# If you prefer a more readable text output:
echo "# Pull Request Summary" > pr_summary.md
echo "" >> pr_summary.md

# Use jq to parse the JSON and format it nicely
cat all_my_prs.json | jq -r '.[] | "## PR #\(.number): \(.title)\n\nRepository: \(.headRepository.nameWithOwner)\nCreated: \(.createdAt)\nMerged: \(.mergedAt)\nURL: \(.url)\n\n### Description\n\(.body)\n\n---\n"' >> pr_summary.md
```

The key difference is using `headRepository` instead of
`repository`. The `headRepository` field correctly identifies the
repository where the PR was created.

If this still produces an error, we can try a different approach:

```bash
# List just the URLs, which contain repository information
gh pr list --author mvollmer --search "created:>2025-01-01 merged:<2025-04-01" --json url --limit 100 | jq -r '.[].url'
```

This will give you the URLs which contain both the repository name and
PR number, which you can then use with `gh pr view` to get the full
details.

You are out of free messages until 5:00 PM

> Ah, bummer.
